Pseudocode for operand button input.

Step 1: Implement single digit integer addition using buttons and return output to console log. Ex: 2 + 2 -> 4.
Note: Multi-digit functionality and stringing multiple operations will be added later!


1. Initialize two empty null variables, "operandA" and "operandB", and an empty string variable "operator".
2. If button pressed has an id of num, start this sequence:

1. If operandA is empty, value of button pressed will be assigned to operandA. Else, value will be assigned to operandB.
2. To continue, button with id of operator must be pressed. Its value will be assinged to "operator" variable.
3. To continue, equals button must be pressed. This will call the operate() function, passing operandA, operandB and operator as arguments.
4. operate() will return the output value, which will be assinged to operandA. operandB reset to null, operator reset to empty string.
